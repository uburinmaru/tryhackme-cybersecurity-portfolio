# TryHackMe - Defensive Security Intro - Learning Log

## ‚úÖ Completed Room: Defensive Security Intro

### Overview
This room covered the fundamentals of defensive security, highlighting how organizations protect systems and respond to threats. We explored the key components of blue team activities, focusing on threat detection, incident response, and digital forensics.

### Key Concepts Learned

#### üîç What is Defensive Security?
- Defensive security focuses on **preventing intrusions** and **detecting/responding** to attacks.
- Unlike offensive security (red team), defensive security is reactive and proactive in maintaining system integrity.
- Blue teams are specialized in defensive strategies.

#### üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Security Roles and Responsibilities
- **Cyber Security Awareness:** Training users to recognize phishing attacks and other threats.
- **Asset Management:** Understanding which systems need protection is crucial for prioritizing defense.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Central to detecting malicious activities.
  - Example: Monitoring login attempts, unknown IP access, and suspicious activities.

#### üè¢ Security Operations Center (SOC)
- A team of cybersecurity professionals who monitor systems 24/7.
- Responsibilities:
  - Detect policy violations
  - Identify unauthorized activity
  - Respond quickly to intrusions
- **Threat Intelligence:** Collecting and analyzing data about potential threats to anticipate attacks.

#### üß© Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
- **Digital Forensics:** Investigating evidence such as:
  - System logs
  - Memory analysis
  - Network traffic
- **Incident Response:** Structured approach to handling security incidents:
  - Preparation
  - Detection & Analysis
  - Containment & Eradication
  - Recovery & Post-Incident Reporting

#### ü¶† Malware Analysis
- **Static Analysis:** Reviewing malware code without execution.
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Executing malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior.

## üñ•Ô∏è Practical Exercise: SIEM Simulation

- Experienced a simulation of **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**.
- Analyzed alerts:
  - Multiple failed login attempts (possible brute-force attack).
  - Suspicious connections from unknown IP addresses.
- Learned to differentiate between benign user mistakes and genuine security incidents.
- Understood how analysts investigate alerts and validate potential threats.

## üß† Reflection

- Defensive security requires not just tools, but also continuous monitoring and human analysis.
- Hands-on SIEM simulation helped in understanding real-world SOC workflows.
- Gained insights into how incidents are detected early and managed effectively.
- Identified importance of logging and how crucial it is for investigation and forensics.

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Advance to the next room: **Search Skills**, to improve threat research capabilities.
- Continue documenting each learning step to build a complete cybersecurity portfolio.
- Aim to explore deeper into SIEM tools and incident response simulations in future labs.
